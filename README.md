# Smart Home Simulator

This simulator was developed as a requirement for the SOEN343 course given at Concordia University. The simulator is meant to replicate a Smart Home envrionment to allow for easy testing of Smart Home Systems without the hassle related to setting up physical systems. The simulator should also provide more consistent and predictable results leading to an overall better testing environment.
